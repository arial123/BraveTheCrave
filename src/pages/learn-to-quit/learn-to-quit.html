      <b>Identify your vape triggers</b>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>Triggers are the things that make you want to vape, like feeling stressed at school or giving in to peer
        pressure. Tracking triggers gives you an idea of when and why you vape. </p>

      <p>Why does this matter? By understanding the times of day or the things that trigger your cravings, you can
        figure out a way to deal with your urges.</p>

      <b>Beat your vape triggers</b>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>For each trigger, identify an activity that will help you cope with your crave. This activity can distract you
        when your trigger hits. </p>
      <p>Cravings typically last 5 to 10 minutes. When you choose an activity instead of vaping, you can distract
        yourself for some time, until the crave passes. Start with waiting for 5 minutes. The next time you feel the
        crave, wait a few more minutes, and so on. It might seem hard at first, but the more separation you can put
        between your triggers and your vape, the more you’ll be breaking the glue that holds them together. Soon, you’ll
        have control over your triggers, which is what quitting is all about.</p>

      <b>3. Avoid Vaping Triggers</b>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>On your quit day, try to avoid triggers. Here are some tips to help you outsmart some common vaping triggers:
        Throw away your vapes, e-liquid bottles, pods, and chargers.
        Go to places where vaping isn’t allowed.
        Stay off social media accounts that remind you of vaping.
        Get plenty of rest and eat healthy. Feeling tired or run down can trigger you to vape.
        Change your routine to avoid the places and things you might associate with vaping.

      <b>4. Ask for Help</b>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>You don’t have to do this alone. Tell your family and friends when your quit day is. Ask them for support on quit day and in the first few days and weeks after. They can help you get through the rough spots. Let them know exactly how they can support you. For example, ask a friend to help you celebrate your first day being vape-free. </p>

      <b>5. Reward Yourself</b>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>At the end of the day, reward yourself for being vape-free for 24 hours. You deserve it! It doesn’t have to be a big or expensive reward. Even taking extra time to do a favorite vape-free activity will make you feel good and help you be ready for day two of your quit attempt.  </p>
